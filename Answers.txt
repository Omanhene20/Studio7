Give two advantages to stream ambiguity:
1. It allows programs to work with different data sources (e.g., files, pipes, network sockets) without needing changes to their source code.
2. It enables modularity, allowing independent processes to be linked dynamically, making it easier to build complex systems with interchangeable components.
